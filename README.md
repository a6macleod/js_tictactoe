# js_tictactoe
browser based tic tac toe game. This was built based on the project from The Odin Project, https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript. 


I built this to practice using javascript modules and factory functions. Additionally, this was great practice for click actions and having dynamically updating the DOM.
